## Cryptography

### The Non Deterministic Cipher
Solves: 60

Hello, my name is Pollux Moore. I have a fascination with algorithms, unpredictability, non-determinism and especially those mathematical relations where one input can map to multiple outputs!
Inspired by this concept, I’ve created what I call an "unbreakable" cipher.
From a single plaintext, you can generate many different ciphertexts!
To show you this, I’ve generated two different ciphertexts from the same plaintext.
Your task is to recover the original message hidden in it:

FEIHLGEEKJHFDK{EAAEKEJHKEDEJFLFHEKDJJFIBFHJDKIBDDGHFBAEDGKGJDHLEHDIJK_FALAAIJIBDJEBDGECHDHIFB_IHHDKHDALAK_IEKIJJIICJC_IEIECGIAAFKEFAGBHEEDKEEGFABDIE}

AGJDCDEGBADJGC{DJFHBGAHBDDGIJLAHGKGIAIACIGJDLFCGDDGFLAGDGLGJEGCGDGAFL_JFCJIFJJKDFEBEEELEDEIIC_IHGDLHHJKIC_JDBFJFIIBJB_IHAEKEFAIFKDJADBGHDEKHGHFFLEAD}

Note: I didn't have time to encrypt the symbols from the flag, so I added the "{" and "_" later, after the encryption process.


### My flag fell down a state cascade! Can you help it get back up?

My flag fell down a state cascade! Can you help it get back up?

### XOR me maybe
Solves: 23

I made a new scheme for encrypting flags, and was so excited that I immediately used it to encrypt a bunch of my flags. Unfortunately, I haven't figured out the decryption part yet. Come to think of it, I've lost my keys as well. And now I forgot one of my flags!

### So random
Solves: 103

We intercepted our enemies' communication of their top-secret flag. However, they use some sort of custom random key that we can't crack! These numbers look so random, our situation seems hopeless.

### Two-time pad
Solves: 226

A one-time pad offers perfect security, but needs tons of keys.

I improved it to only need half as many keys! I'm gonna be a millionaire!

### In Crypto We Trust
Solves: 108

You're a cryptanalyst in pain, examining the encrypted data,
searching for subtle patterns used by this black hat. What could it be ?

## DNS

### DNS Scavenger Hunt
Solves: 41

I sat up high, then took a dive,
Yet my message must survive.
Scrambled words, locked up tight,
Hidden well, out of sight.
A secret path, a site to see,
Find my letter at justnuisance.be!
Who am I?

(Note: You need to use the DNS server specified below.)

The server is listening on
dig @dns_scavenger_hunt.challenges.cybersecuritychallenge.be -p 53


### Command and control
Solves: 16

IDS Alert: Suspicious DNS queries detected! An internal workstation has been sending DNS queries to smallbank.be,
and it’s raising some serious eyebrows.

This isn’t your usual traffic—something funky is happening at the protocol level.
The validating DNS resolver which triggered the IDS alert is 54.228.245.186

This is no ordinary DNS snooping mission. Sharpen your tools, dig deep (pun intended), and follow the packets.


### CHAOS IN THE KITCHEN SINK
Solves: 210


Imagine diving into a kitchen sink that's a chaotic wonderland of dirty dishes, rogue utensils, and mysterious leftovers.
Your mission? To find a hidden flag amidst this culinary catastrophe.
It's like playing hide-and-seek with a ninja spoon!
In this scenario, CHAOS is not just a state—it's a class !
To make your search easier, use the DNS (Domain Name System) protocol.
Just as DNS helps you find the exact address of a website among billions of possibilities, it will guide you to locate the flag in this mess.
Ready to tackle the CHAOS class and find that elusive flag in the SINK (DNS TYPE 40) ?

Let's get scrubbing and let DNS lead the way!

Start with the following info:
- domain name : dishes.be
- hints : hints.dishes.be
- server IP address : See below

dig @chaos_in_the_kitchen_sink.challenges.cybersecuritychallenge.be -p 5053

### The mystical formula
Solves: 79

In the medieval realm of Eldergrove, a land steeped in mystery and magic, a new adventure awaits those daring enough to accept the challenge. At the heart of this tale lies the ancient art of alchemy, a practice shrouded in secrecy and wonder, promising the transformation of the mundane into the extraordinary.
The story begins in the bustling town of Alchemor, known throughout the kingdom for its legendary alchemical guild. Within the shadowed halls of the guild, a recent excavation unearthed a peculiar artifact—a tome, bound in dragonhide, its pages filled with cryptic numbers.
The tome, upon examination, revealed itself to be the lost Codex of the Alchemist Arcanus, a revered figure whose experiments sought to unlock the secrets of transmutation and eternal life. The numbers, it seemed, were a crucial part of his final experiment, an endeavor that promised to turn base metals into gold and grant the wielder untold power.
However, the true meaning of the numbers remained elusive, as the Codex was written in a cipher known only to the most skilled alchemists. The guild's finest minds have struggled to decode its mysteries, their efforts thwarted by the complexity of the cipher and the enigmatic nature of the numbers.
Thus, the challenge is set before you, brave contender. Can you decipher the alchemical code and reveal the secrets of the Codex of Arcanus? Success will grant you not only the admiration of the guild but also a glimpse into the profound mysteries of alchemy itself. May your intellect and perseverance guide you on this quest for enlightenment.

### The Cursed Fridge
Solves: 20

During your travels through time, you've encountered many odd figures.

One of them became a good friend, John, and he spoke of many things he came across in his adventures.

One day, hearing of one of your many adventures pentesting a wizard's castle, he pulls out a rusty key, and slides it across the table.

"My friend", he says, "this, is my old, cursed fridge. I paid a pretty penny back in the day for it, but I had a disagreement with it, and it refuses my key now."
Confused, you look at him while reaching for the key, and, as if to play on your competitive spirit,
he adds "There's something very dear to me, an old flag, from a kingdom long forgotten. Maybe you could bear it's crown?"

### The Bard's Enigma
Solves: 129

In the quaint village of Stratford-upon-Avon, nestled amidst the verdant meadows and whispering brooks, there was discovered a most curious relic. Within the dusty confines of an ancient oak chest, hidden away in the attic of a long-forgotten cottage, lay a parchment of exquisite antiquity. Alongside this relic was a document, its contents obscured by an enigmatic cipher.
The parchment, upon closer inspection, revealed itself to be a hitherto unknown poem, penned by none other than the illustrious bard himself, Silliam Whakespeare. The verses, rich with the eloquence and grace of the Elizabethan tongue, spoke of love and longing, of dreams unfulfilled and promises unbroken.
Yet, the accompanying document was an enigma. Its script was indecipherable, a jumble of letters and symbols that defied all attempts at comprehension. Scholars from near and far gathered to unravel its secrets, but the cipher remained unyielding, a silent guardian of its hidden truths.
Thus, the challenge is laid before you, noble seeker of knowledge. Canst thou decipher the cryptic code and unveil the mysteries that lie within?. Engage thy wit and wisdom, and may fortune favor thee in this quest of discovery.
